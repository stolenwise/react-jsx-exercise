For this assignment you will be creating three components:  ***FirstComponent***  renders an *h1* with the text “My very first component”.  ***NamedComponent***  renders a *p* that should accept a property of “name” and display text “My name is *name*”.  ***App***  renders a *div* with instances of the other two components.
